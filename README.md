# Range slider in javascript

Small library to specify a range. See the `index.html` or [this link](https://rasmusfonseca.github.io/JSRangeSlider/) for a small example of how to use the library. Set default values in the header of the `rangeslider.js` file.

Note: This library has a small bug I've been unable to fix. If you drag near the border of the slider it will sometimes stop and start dragging something else (a small document icon appears at the curser). If you have any idea how to solve this I'm happy to take contributions.
